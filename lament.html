            <h2>A Lament for What Could Have Been</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <p>My child, I'm so sorry. Your dad tried his best, but it wasn't enough. I wish I could have done more. I wish I could have made some better decision, or choice, or found a better option that would have saved you. I was powerless to help you. I've been told that, that could be a blessing. We did everything we could and it still wasn't meant to be. But I hate that.</p>
 
            <p>I'm so sorry that we never got to meet. I wish I could have known what gender you were. We had names picked out for you, but I can't bear to type them here.</p>
 
            <p>Your mom and I did everything we were supposed to do. We followed the orders. We followed the advice. We did the hard things. Yet, it still wasn't enough. Lord knows how much this hurts. He says that He weeps with me, for you, and I pray that it's true. This hurts to type. It hurts to feel. I have to make the choice to let myself feel. I can distract myself for days at a time so I don't have to think about what might have been. It mgiht not be healthy, but it's all I know. There's now a void in my heart where you fit perfectly.</p>
 
            <p>You'll never know this, or maybe you do, but I was excited to get to raise you. I wanted so badly for your mom and I to correct the mistakes of our parents. You would have been my first child. My pride and joy. I lament because I don't get to know who you are. I will never get to see you grow up. I'll never watch you meet Christ here on earth. Lord, I hate that this is so. The Lord has done incredible works in me. All the healing, and growth, and redemption led me to you.</p>
 
            <p>I won't pretend to be okay anymore. I have to wrestle with our Creator. This doesn't sit right with me. How can a servant of the Lord be punished like this. Why would He make me feel this despair? What good could come of this? I'm so blinded by my misery; my anger, that I can't see the positives that may bless your mom and I. I would trade it all so that we could be together. A happy little family.</p>
 
            <p>How can a good and loving God do this? What am I supposed to learn? Blind trust? Faithful trust?</p>
 
            <p>He let me see your heartbeat, I know that you were alive, I saw it. Lord, I saw it, and you took it away from me.</p>
 
            <p>In my pain, I have sunk lowly. I have led myself into isolation, with only an impulsive thought from God, that I should reach out to my brothers. For all the knowledge I possess, for all the creative solutions I conjure up, and for all the power my brain has, I cannot defeat my own sadness. The loss of you, has ripped my heart into pieces.</p>
 
            <p>I don't want to talk about anything. I don't want to be around people. I don't want to talk to other parents with kids. I don't want to be around them. They're everywhere. They don't realize the gifts they have. How can a meth addicted whore, barely scraping by in life, carry a child to full-term, and then give it up for adoption, or worse, choose to keep it and drag it through hell. My only thoughts are that misery loves company. They'll use their children as shields, or as sources of income. They are not considered the gifts from God as they should be. They are dollar-sign shields from their poor life choices.</p>
 
            <p>I don't understand any of this. I don't understand why this happens. It doesn't make sense. There's no reasonable path of choices that lead to an acceptable conclusion.</p>
 
            <p>I'm so angry, but, if I didn't have this anger, I wouldn't have anything. I would be numb to everything. It's a fire that drives me, but also destroys me. Mutually assured destruction of my own self.</p>
 
            <p>Lord, I pray that you have my child in heaven with You. I pray that you both look down on me; perhaps that your spirits dwell with me. I pray that you would reach out to me and help me feel something better; something holy. Lord, You say that You love children. I pray that it's true. I Know that You don't lie, so please, show me something, anything.</p>
 
            <p>I am finding it hard to praise You right now. It's excruciatingly hard because it was Your choice to take my child. I have to learn to be okay with that. Some people have said that perhaps He took you because something was wrong with you. Something that wouldn't have given you a good life. I don't believe that. He lets other children suffer and have near-meaningless lives, and ultimately die a very undeserved death. At least, that's my perspective. It is something I've witnessed.</p>
 
            <p>Lord, it is said that nothing surprises you. If that's true, then my anger towards you has to be expected. You must know it, or feel it, in some way. I pray that You take this anger away from me. I don't want to be mad at you, I don't want to hate the decisions you make. I want to have that full faith, leap-from-the-rooftops faith in You. Right now, though, I have such little faith. I'm bringing what I can to You. I have a new problem. I fear to ask anything from You. I asked for this child, and You took them. Why would I ask anything else of You?</p>
 
            <p>Until we meet on the other side of life, I lament because</p>
 
<p>I have to let go of the dreams surrounding you, my child.</p>
<p>I won't get to build and paint your room.</p>
<p>I won't get to feed you, bathe you, and rock you to sleep.</p>
<p>You won't pull at my beard as babies do.</p>
<p>We'll never hold each other's hands.</p>
<p>I won't get to kiss you goodnight.</p>
<p>I won't get to hold you.</p>
<p>You'll never run to our room in the middle of the night from a bad dream.</p>
<p>I'll never see your first sports game, or recital.</p>
<p>I won't get to witness you taste your mother's good cooking.</p>
<p>I'll never drive you to your first day at school.</p>
<p>I'll never see any life events.</p>
<p>I'll never see you.</p>

<p>I never even got to say hello.</p>

 
            My child, I miss you. I pray that when I get to heaven, you’ll meet me at the gates. I pray that I’ll know you. I don’t want to miss you again. Until then, I love you.
            </p>
            <p> -Your Dad.</p>
